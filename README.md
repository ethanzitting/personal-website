Welcome! This is the code for my personal website.
This uses my tech stack for static websites.
I write in HTML/SCSS/JS, using modules from NPM.
I have NPM, Webpack, and Live-Reload in my dev environment.
After my code is compiled into the production HTML/CSS/JS,
I push it up to GitHub, and then pull it down to my cloud server.
My cloud server is a digital ocean droplet running Apache2 on Ubuntu.
